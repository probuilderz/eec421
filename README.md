Software Enigneering projects:

The objective is to implement a simple maze. 

To design model used here was previously a waterfall model.
But we will try to similate an agile model by incementaly delivering a working solution.


As of 9/23/2015:
 - The software has change in such a way that the user is able to change the size of the maze.
 - the user is also asked if s/he wants to play the demo again.
 - The resquest is printed into the console.
 
New Challenge:
 - Be able to display the request through the Applet, not the console.
 - Be able to print the time it take to reach destination, meaning solving the maze
 - Show the final path in the text descriptive format. For example: Forward, Turn Left, Forward, Turn Right, Forward, Forward.
